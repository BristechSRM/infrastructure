# MySql Docker image

Note: to use this docker image, you'll need to copy the db create script from `{infrastructureRoot}/database/scripts/0/db-create.sql` to this folder. 
In this folder the file `db-create.sql` has been ignored so that the proper location for the db scripts doesn't get mixed up. 

In the future, when there are versions, the docker file will need to be modified to run these version scripts as well when creating a container.
